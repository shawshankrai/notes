## Is identity and principal same in GCP

    No, identity and principal are not the same in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), but they are related: 

        Identity
        An identity is a Google account, service account, Google group, Google Workspace account, Cloud Identity domain, or other entity that can access a GCP resource. 

        Principal
        A principal is an identity that has been granted access to a GCP resource. Principals can be assigned roles and bound to resources using Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
         
        Role
        A role is a collection of permissions that determine which operations can be used on a specific resource. 

        Policy
        A policy is a role constraint that binds a principal to a specific action for a resource.
